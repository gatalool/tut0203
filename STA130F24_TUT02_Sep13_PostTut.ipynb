    "## What's the difference between a tuple and a list in python?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, both tuples and lists are used to store collections of items, but they have some important differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mutability**:\n",
    "   - **List**: Lists are mutable, which means you can change their content (add, remove, or modify elements) after they are created. For example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "     my_list[0] = 10  # This changes the first element to 10\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - **Tuple**: Tuples are immutable, which means once they are created, their content cannot be changed. Any attempt to modify a tuple will result in an error. For example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "     my_tuple[0] = 10  # This will raise a TypeError\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Syntax**:\n",
    "   - **List**: Lists are created using square brackets `[]`. For example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - **Tuple**: Tuples are created using parentheses `()`. For example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Performance**:\n",
    "   - **List**: Due to their mutability, lists generally have more overhead for operations such as adding or removing elements.\n",
    "   - **Tuple**: Tuples, being immutable, are often faster and use less memory compared to lists. This can be beneficial for performance-sensitive applications or when using tuples as keys in dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Use Cases**:\n",
    "   - **List**: Use lists when you need a collection of items that might need to be modified during program execution.\n",
    "   - **Tuple**: Use tuples when you need a collection of items that should remain constant throughout the program. Tuples are often used to represent fixed collections of items, such as coordinates or records.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Methods**:\n",
    "   - **List**: Lists have a variety of built-in methods like `append()`, `extend()`, `remove()`, and `pop()` for modifying their contents.\n",
    "   - **Tuple**: Tuples have fewer methods, mainly `count()` and `index()`, since they are immutable and cannot be modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here‚Äôs a simple example to illustrate these points:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# List example\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "my_list.append(4)  # Modify the list\n",
    "print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Tuple example\n",
    "my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "# my_tuple.append(4)  # This would raise an AttributeError\n",
    "print(my_tuple)  # Output: (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, choose between a list and a tuple based on whether you need to modify the collection and consider performance implications."

    "## Demonstrate how a tuple works in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Certainly! Tuples in Python are quite straightforward to use. Let‚Äôs walk through some common operations and examples to demonstrate how they work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Basic Tuple Creation**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # A tuple with integers\n",
    "   my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "   print(my_tuple)  # Output: (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Single Element Tuple**:\n",
    "   When creating a tuple with a single element, you need to include a trailing comma:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   single_element_tuple = (5,)\n",
    "   print(single_element_tuple)  # Output: (5,)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Tuple Without Parentheses**:\n",
    "   Parentheses are optional when creating a tuple. For example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   another_tuple = 1, 2, 3\n",
    "   print(another_tuple)  # Output: (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accessing Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "You can access elements in a tuple using indexing (zero-based index):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_tuple = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)\n",
    "print(my_tuple[0])  # Output: 10\n",
    "print(my_tuple[2])  # Output: 30\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Slicing Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "You can slice tuples to get a subset of elements:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_tuple = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)\n",
    "print(my_tuple[1:4])  # Output: (20, 30, 40)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tuple Unpacking\n",
    "\n",
    "You can unpack a tuple into individual variables:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_tuple = (10, 20, 30)\n",
    "a, b, c = my_tuple\n",
    "print(a)  # Output: 10\n",
    "print(b)  # Output: 20\n",
    "print(c)  # Output: 30\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nested Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples can contain other tuples:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "nested_tuple = (1, (2, 3), (4, 5))\n",
    "print(nested_tuple)  # Output: (1, (2, 3), (4, 5))\n",
    "print(nested_tuple[1])  # Output: (2, 3)\n",
    "print(nested_tuple[1][0])  # Output: 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tuple Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples have only two built-in methods: `count()` and `index()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **count()**: Counts how many times a value appears in the tuple.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_tuple = (1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3)\n",
    "   print(my_tuple.count(2))  # Output: 2\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **index()**: Finds the index of the first occurrence of a value.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "   print(my_tuple.index(2))  # Output: 1\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Immutability\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples are immutable. You cannot change their elements after creation:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "# my_tuple[0] = 10  # This would raise a TypeError\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tuple as Dictionary Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "Since tuples are immutable, they can be used as keys in dictionaries, while lists cannot:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_dict = {}\n",
    "key_tuple = (1, 2)\n",
    "my_dict[key_tuple] = \"value\"\n",
    "print(my_dict)  # Output: {(1, 2): 'value'}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concatenation and Repetition\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples support concatenation and repetition:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "tuple1 = (1, 2)\n",
    "tuple2 = (3, 4)\n",
    "print(tuple1 + tuple2)  # Output: (1, 2, 3, 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "tuple3 = (5,)\n",
    "print(tuple3 * 3)  # Output: (5, 5, 5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples cover the basics of working with tuples in Python. They are simple yet powerful tools for grouping related items together, especially when you need to ensure the grouped items remain unchanged throughout the program."

    "## How to you measure the length of a tuple?\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure the length of a tuple in Python, you use the built-in `len()` function. This function returns the number of elements in the tuple. Here‚Äôs how you can use it:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Creating a tuple\n",
    "my_tuple = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Measuring the length of the tuple\n",
    "length = len(my_tuple)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Printing the length\n",
    "print(length)  # Output: 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `len()` function calculates that there are 5 elements in `my_tuple`, so it returns `5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Here‚Äôs another example with a tuple containing nested tuples:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Creating a tuple with nested tuples\n",
    "nested_tuple = (1, (2, 3), (4, 5))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Measuring the length of the outer tuple\n",
    "length = len(nested_tuple)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Printing the length\n",
    "print(length)  # Output: 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, `len(nested_tuple)` returns `3` because the outer tuple contains three elements, even though two of those elements are themselves tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `len()` function provides a straightforward way to determine the number of items in any tuple, regardless of whether they are simple values or more complex structures like nested tuples."

    "## Demonstrate how a dictionary works\n",
    "\n",
    "Certainly! Dictionaries in Python are collections of key-value pairs. They are also known as associative arrays or hash maps in other programming languages. Dictionaries are mutable, meaning you can change them after creation, and they allow you to store data in a way that makes it easy to retrieve using unique keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Basic Dictionary Creation**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_dict = {\n",
    "       \"name\": \"Alice\",\n",
    "       \"age\": 30,\n",
    "       \"city\": \"New York\"\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   print(my_dict)  # Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dictionary with Different Data Types**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_dict = {\n",
    "       \"name\": \"Bob\",\n",
    "       \"age\": 25,\n",
    "       \"is_student\": True,\n",
    "       \"grades\": [88, 92, 85]\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   print(my_dict)  # Output: {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 25, 'is_student': True, 'grades': [88, 92, 85]}\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accessing Values\n",
    "\n",
    "You can access the value associated with a specific key using square brackets `[]`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_dict = {\"name\": \"Charlie\", \"age\": 28}\n",
    "print(my_dict[\"name\"])  # Output: Charlie\n",
    "print(my_dict[\"age\"])   # Output: 28\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding or Updating Items\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add new key-value pairs or update existing ones by assigning a value to a key:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_dict = {\"name\": \"Diana\"}\n",
    "my_dict[\"age\"] = 35  # Adding a new key-value pair\n",
    "my_dict[\"name\"] = \"Diana Prince\"  # Updating an existing key-value pair\n",
    "print(my_dict)  # Output: {'name': 'Diana Prince', 'age': 35}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Removing Items\n",
    "\n",
    "You can remove items from a dictionary using various methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Using `del`**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_dict = {\"name\": \"Eve\", \"age\": 29}\n",
    "   del my_dict[\"age\"]\n",
    "   print(my_dict)  # Output: {'name': 'Eve'}\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Using `pop()`**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_dict = {\"name\": \"Frank\", \"age\": 40}\n",
    "   age = my_dict.pop(\"age\")\n",
    "   print(age)      # Output: 40\n",
    "   print(my_dict)  # Output: {'name': 'Frank'}\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Using `popitem()`** (removes and returns the last inserted key-value pair):\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_dict = {\"name\": \"Grace\", \"age\": 32}\n",
    "   item = my_dict.popitem()\n",
    "   print(item)     # Output: ('age', 32)\n",
    "   print(my_dict)  # Output: {'name': 'Grace'}\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Using `clear()`** (removes all items):\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_dict = {\"name\": \"Hannah\", \"age\": 27}\n",
    "   my_dict.clear()\n",
    "   print(my_dict)  # Output: {}\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Checking for Key Existence\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check if a key is in a dictionary using the `in` operator:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_dict = {\"name\": \"Ivy\", \"age\": 24}\n",
    "print(\"name\" in my_dict)  # Output: True\n",
    "print(\"city\" in my_dict)  # Output: False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dictionary Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries have several useful methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`keys()`**: Returns a view object of all the keys in the dictionary.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  my_dict = {\"name\": \"Jack\", \"age\": 31}\n",
    "  print(my_dict.keys())  # Output: dict_keys(['name', 'age'])\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`values()`**: Returns a view object of all the values in the dictionary.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  print(my_dict.values())  # Output: dict_values(['Jack', 31])\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`items()`**: Returns a view object of all the key-value pairs in the dictionary.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  print(my_dict.items())  # Output: dict_items([('name', 'Jack'), ('age', 31)])\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`get()`**: Returns the value for a specified key, or a default value if the key is not found.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  print(my_dict.get(\"name\"))        # Output: Jack\n",
    "  print(my_dict.get(\"city\", \"N/A\"))  # Output: N/A\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`update()`**: Updates the dictionary with key-value pairs from another dictionary or iterable of key-value pairs.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  my_dict = {\"name\": \"Karen\"}\n",
    "  my_dict.update({\"age\": 28, \"city\": \"London\"})\n",
    "  print(my_dict)  # Output: {'name': 'Karen', 'age': 28, 'city': 'London'}\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nested Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries can contain other dictionaries, creating a nested structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "nested_dict = {\n",
    "    \"person\": {\n",
    "        \"name\": \"Liam\",\n",
    "        \"age\": 33\n",
    "    },\n",
    "    \"address\": {\n",
    "        \"city\": \"San Francisco\",\n",
    "        \"state\": \"CA\"\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "print(nested_dict[\"person\"][\"name\"])  # Output: Liam\n",
    "print(nested_dict[\"address\"][\"city\"])  # Output: San Francisco\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dictionary Comprehensions\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create dictionaries using comprehensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "squares = {x: x**2 for x in range(6)}\n",
    "print(squares)  # Output: {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25}\n",
    "```\n",

    "## Can you demonstrate the dict function\n",
    "\n",
    "Certainly! The `dict()` function in Python is a built-in function that creates dictionaries. It can be used in several ways to create dictionaries from various types of input. Here's a comprehensive look at how the `dict()` function works:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating Dictionaries with `dict()`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **From Keyword Arguments**:\n",
    "   You can create a dictionary by passing key-value pairs as keyword arguments to the `dict()` function:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_dict = dict(name=\"Alice\", age=30, city=\"New York\")\n",
    "   print(my_dict)  # Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **From a List of Tuples**:\n",
    "   You can create a dictionary from a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a key-value pair:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   items = [(\"name\", \"Bob\"), (\"age\", 25), (\"city\", \"Chicago\")]\n",
    "   my_dict = dict(items)\n",
    "   print(my_dict)  # Output: {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 25, 'city': 'Chicago'}\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **From a List of Lists**:\n",
    "   Similar to tuples, you can use a list of lists to create a dictionary:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   items = [[\"name\", \"Charlie\"], [\"age\", 28], [\"city\", \"San Francisco\"]]\n",
    "   my_dict = dict(items)\n",
    "   print(my_dict)  # Output: {'name': 'Charlie', 'age': 28, 'city': 'San Francisco'}\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Using `zip()` to Combine Lists**:\n",
    "   You can create a dictionary by combining two lists‚Äîone for keys and one for values‚Äîusing the `zip()` function:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   keys = [\"name\", \"age\", \"city\"]\n",
    "   values = [\"Diana\", 32, \"Los Angeles\"]\n",
    "   my_dict = dict(zip(keys, values))\n",
    "   print(my_dict)  # Output: {'name': 'Diana', 'age': 32, 'city': 'Los Angeles'}\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **From a Dictionary Comprehension**:\n",
    "   You can also use a dictionary comprehension with `dict()` to create dictionaries:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_dict = dict((x, x**2) for x in range(5))\n",
    "   print(my_dict)  # Output: {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16}\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **From a String with `dict()` (Unusual Case)**:\n",
    "   You can use the `dict()` function with a string containing key-value pairs if the string is in the format suitable for conversion (though this is less common):\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_dict = dict([(\"key1\", \"value1\"), (\"key2\", \"value2\")])\n",
    "   print(my_dict)  # Output: {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Here‚Äôs a comprehensive example demonstrating several ways to use `dict()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Using keyword arguments\n",
    "dict1 = dict(name=\"Eve\", age=29, city=\"Boston\")\n",
    "print(\"dict1:\", dict1)  # Output: {'name': 'Eve', 'age': 29, 'city': 'Boston'}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using a list of tuples\n",
    "list_of_tuples = [(\"name\", \"Frank\"), (\"age\", 41), (\"city\", \"Seattle\")]\n",
    "dict2 = dict(list_of_tuples)\n",
    "print(\"dict2:\", dict2)  # Output: {'name': 'Frank', 'age': 41, 'city': 'Seattle'}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using a list of lists\n",
    "list_of_lists = [[\"name\", \"Grace\"], [\"age\", 35], [\"city\", \"San Diego\"]]\n",
    "dict3 = dict(list_of_lists)\n",
    "print(\"dict3:\", dict3)  # Output: {'name': 'Grace', 'age': 35, 'city': 'San Diego'}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using zip to combine lists\n",
    "keys = [\"name\", \"age\", \"city\"]\n",
    "values = [\"Hannah\", 27, \"Denver\"]\n",
    "dict4 = dict(zip(keys, values))\n",
    "print(\"dict4:\", dict4)  # Output: {'name': 'Hannah', 'age': 27, 'city': 'Denver'}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using dictionary comprehension\n",
    "dict5 = dict((x, x**3) for x in range(4))\n",
    "print(\"dict5:\", dict5)  # Output: {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 8, 3: 27}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the `dict()` function is highly versatile and can be used to create dictionaries from various types of input. It provides a flexible way to initialize dictionaries with different formats and data structures."

    "In NumPy, adding arrays of different sizes is handled using a feature called broadcasting. Broadcasting allows NumPy to perform arithmetic operations on arrays of different shapes in a way that makes sense, as long as the arrays are compatible according to certain rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Broadcasting Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The dimensions are compared starting from the last dimension and working backwards.**\n",
    "2. **Dimensions are compatible when:**\n",
    "   - They are equal, or\n",
    "   - One of them is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the dimensions do not meet these criteria, NumPy will raise an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples of Broadcasting\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples to illustrate how broadcasting works in NumPy:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1: Scalar and Array\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding a scalar to an array:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])\n",
    "scalar = 5\n",
    "result = arr + scalar\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: [ 6  7  8  9]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the scalar `5` is broadcasted to the shape of the array `arr`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2: 1D Array and 2D Array\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding a 1D array to a 2D array:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "arr2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])\n",
    "arr1d = np.array([10, 20, 30])\n",
    "result = arr2d + arr1d\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "# Output:\n",
    "# [[11 22 33]\n",
    "#  [14 25 36]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `arr1d` is broadcasted to match the shape of `arr2d`, so it effectively adds `10`, `20`, and `30` to each row of the 2D array.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 3: 2D Array and 2D Array with Different Shapes\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding two 2D arrays with compatible shapes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "arr2d_a = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])\n",
    "arr2d_b = np.array([[10], [20]])\n",
    "result = arr2d_a + arr2d_b\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "# Output:\n",
    "# [[11 12 13]\n",
    "#  [24 25 26]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, `arr2d_b` is broadcasted to match the shape of `arr2d_a`. The array `arr2d_b` with shape `(2, 1)` is broadcast to shape `(2, 3)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 4: 3D Array and 2D Array\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding a 3D array to a 2D array:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "arr3d = np.array([[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]])\n",
    "arr2d = np.array([[10, 20, 30], [40, 50, 60]])\n",
    "result = arr3d + arr2d\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "# Output:\n",
    "# [[[11 22 33]\n",
    "#   [44 55 66]]\n",
    "# \n",
    "#  [[17 28 39]\n",
    "#   [50 61 72]]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `arr2d` is broadcasted to match the shape of `arr3d`. The shape of `arr3d` is `(2, 2, 3)` and `arr2d` is broadcasted to this shape for the addition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadcasting allows for efficient computation by enabling NumPy to handle arrays of different shapes in a compatible manner. The key is to understand the broadcasting rules and ensure that the dimensions of the arrays align according to those rules. If the arrays are not compatible for broadcasting, NumPy will raise a `ValueError`."

    "4. **Switch or Stick**: The contestant can either switch to the remaining door or stick with their initial choice.\n",

    "### Expected Results\n",
    "\n",
